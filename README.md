# Data Warehouse Project - Medallion Architecture with SSMS

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Data Warehouse using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), combined with the Medallion Architecture, to efficiently process, clean, and structure raw data for business analysis.

The project follows a layered data processing approach to ensure data quality, scalability, and efficient reporting, simulating how businesses structure their data for decision-making.
